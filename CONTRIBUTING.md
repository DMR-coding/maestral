## Guidelines

### Checking the Format, Coding Style, and Type Hints

Code is formatted with [black](https://github.com/psf/black),
and docstrings are formatted with [blackdoc](https://github.com/keewis/blackdoc).
Coding style is checked with [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org) and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/),
and additional conventions are described in the [Wiki](https://github.com/optuna/optuna/wiki/Coding-Style-Conventions).
Type hints, [PEP484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/), are checked with [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/).

You can check the format, coding style, and type hint at the same time just by executing a script `checks.sh`.
If your environment misses some dependencies such as black, flake8, isort or mypy, 
you will be asked to install them.

```bash
# Without any fixes.
bash checks.sh

# With fixes on the format by `black` and the import order by `isort`.
bash checks.sh -u
```

### Documentation

When adding a new feature to the framework, you also need to document it in the reference.
The documentation source is stored under the [docs](./docs) directory and written in [reStructuredText format](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html).

To build the documentation, you need to run:

```bash
pip install -e ".[document]"
```

Then you can build the documentation in HTML format locally:

```bash
cd docs
make html
```

HTML files are generated under `build/html` directory. Open `index.html` with the browser and see
if it is rendered as expected.

## Unit Tests

When adding a new feature or fixing a bug, you also need to write sufficient test code.
We use [pytest](https://pytest.org/) as the testing framework and
unit tests are stored under the [tests directory](./tests).

You can run all your tests as follows:

```bash
# Run all the unit tests.
pytest

# Run all the unit tests defined in the specified test file.
pytest tests/${TARGET_TEST_FILE_NAME}
```
