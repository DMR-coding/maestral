.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   This module defines base classes for desktop notifications. All platform implementations
   must inherit from :class:`DesktopNotifierBase`.

.. py:class:: NotificationLevel

   Bases: :class:`enum.Enum`

   Enumeration of notification levels. The interpretation and visuals will depend
   on the platform.

   :cvar Critical: For critical errors.
   :cvar Normal: Default platform notification level.
   :cvar Low: Low priority notification.


.. py:class:: Notification(title: str, message: str, urgency: NotificationLevel = NotificationLevel.Normal, icon: Optional[str] = None, action: Optional[Callable] = None, buttons: Optional[Dict[str, Optional[Callable]]] = None)

   A desktop notification

   :param title: Notification title.
   :param message: Notification message.
   :param urgency: Notification level: low, normal or critical. This is ignored by some
       implementations.
   :param icon: Path to an icon to use for the notification, typically the app icon.
       This is ignored by some implementations, e.g., on macOS where the icon of the
       app bundle is always used.
   :param action: Handler to call when the notification is clicked. This is ignored by
       some implementations.
   :param buttons: A dictionary with button names to show in the notification and
       handler to call when the respective button is clicked. This is ignored by some
       implementations.

   :ivar identifier: An identifier which gets assigned to the notification after it is
       sent. This may be a str or int, depending on the type of identifier used by the
       platform.


.. py:class:: DesktopNotifierBase(app_name: str = '', app_id: str = '', notification_limit: int = 5)

   Base class for desktop notifications. Notification levels CRITICAL, NORMAL and LOW
   may be used by some implementations to determine how a notification is displayed.

   :param app_name: Name to identify the application in the notification center. On
       Linux, this should correspond to the application name in a desktop entry. On
       macOS, this field is discarded and the app is identified by the bundle id of the
       sending program (e.g., Python).
   :param notification_limit: Maximum number of notifications to keep in the system's
       notification center. This may be ignored by some implementations.

   .. method:: send(self, notification: Notification) -> None
      :abstractmethod:

      Some arguments may be ignored, depending on the implementation.
