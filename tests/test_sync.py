# Create a Dropbox test account to automate the below test.

# standard and challenging cases.

def test_sync_cases():
    # Currently those tests are performed manually with the following test cases:
    #
    # CC = conflicting copy
    #
    #  * Remote file replaced with a folder (OK): Check mtime and create CC of local file
    #    if necessary.
    #  * Remote folder replaced with a file (OK):
    #    Recurse through ctimes of children and check if we have any un-synced changes.
    #    If yes, create CCs for those items. Others will be deleted.
    #  * Local file replaced with a folder (OK):
    #    Check server-modified time of file and only delete if older. Otherwise, let
    #    Dropbox handle creating a CC.
    #  * Local folder replaced with a file (NOK):
    #    Remote folder is currently not checked for unsynced changes but a CC is created
    #    by default. We could recurse through all remote files and check for unsynced
    #    changes.
    #  * Remote and local items modified during sync pause (OK)
    #  * Remote and local items created during sync pause (OK)
    #  * Remote and local items deleted during sync pause (OK)
    #  * Local item created / modified -> registered for upload -> deleted before up: (OK)
    #    Ok because FileNotFoundError will be caught silently.
    #  * Local item created / modified -> uploaded -> deleted before re-download: (OK)
    #    Will not be re-downloaded if rev is still in index.
    #  * Local item created / modified -> uploaded -> modified before re-download: (OK)
    #    Will not be re-downloaded if rev is the same.
    #  * Local item deleted -> uploaded -> created before re-download: (OK)
    #    Local rev == remote rev == None. Deletion will not be carried out.
    #  * Remote item created -> registered -> local item created before download (OK):
    #    Local rev is None but file exists => CC created.
    #  * Remote item deleted -> registered -> local item created before download (OK):
    #    Local rev == remote rev == None. Deletion will not be carried out.
    #  * Remote item deleted -> registered -> local item deleted before download (OK):
    #    Local rev exists: deletion will be carried out locally and fail silently.
    #  * Remote item deleted -> registered -> local item modified before download (OK):
    #    Local rev != None, deletion will be carried out. Fix by comparing mtime and
    #    keep local item if local_mtime > last_sync.
    #  * Remote item modified -> registered -> local item modified before download (OK):
    #    Local rev != remote rev. Compare ctime and create CC if ctime > last_sync and
    #    file contents are different.
